					<h2>NECA and Education</h2>
					<p>The Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter has always been proud of our ability to 
					provide the best educational programs and seminars available.  As a benefit 
					of NECA membership you can participate in Educational Programs developed 
					by the Management Educational Institute (MEI) of NECA.  Currently there 
					are over forty (40) management development courses offered by MEI and 
					sponsored by the Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter, all of which are related to 
					the electrical industry.  Some of the areas covered in these seminars 
					are: Estimating, Project Management, Project Scheduling, Project Finance 
					and three (3) levels of Electrical Project Supervision.</p>
					<p>Every one of the forty (40) courses offered by MEI carry Continuing 
					Education Credits, a requirement for renewal of a State Electrical License 
					in both Delaware and New Jersey.  The Chapter also offers an Electrical 
					Code update course to meet the State Licensing requirements.</p>
					<p>Safety is also addressed in our course offering.  The Chapter has 
					three (3) OSHA certified instructors to conduct both the OSHA ten (10) 
					hour and thirty (30) hour construction safety course, a Fall Protection 
					course and a CPR/First Aid course.</p>
					<p>Throughout the year the Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter offers seminars covering 
					any "hot topics" affecting our area such as: The Steel Crisis, Prevailing 
					Wage Seminar, Preservation, Preparation and Presentation of Construction Claims.</p>
					<p>The Chapter also offers an Industry awareness seminar titled "Who We 
					Are And What It Takes To Be A Successful Electrical Contractor" to all 
					of our apprentices in our JATC programs.</p>
					<p>Our commitment to education is a top priority in our Chapter and 
					speaking of top priority the Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter is the #1 Chapter 
					in the country in the distribution of the National Electrical Installation 
					Standard (NEIS) for our electrical industry.</p>
