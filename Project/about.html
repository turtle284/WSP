					<h2>History of the Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter, NECA</h2>
					<p>Prior to 1939 in the Philadelphia area, there existed a loosely 
					organized group of electrical contractors called the Electrical 
					Constructors of Philadelphia. The membership numbered approximately 
					10 contractors and their purpose was to meet and share common interests 
					with their industry peers.</p>
					<p>In September of 1938 with the realization that much more could be 
					accomplished for the common good of the electrical contracting industry 
					through a more organized and strengthened association, one of the members 
					of the Electrical Constructors of Philadelphia traveled to Detroit, 
					Michigan to attend the 35th Anniversary Convention of the National 
					Electrical Contractors Association, (NECA). </p>
					<p>The primary mission of this contractor was to convince NECA to bring 
					its national convention to Philadelphia the following year. The group of 
					electrical contractors in the Philadelphia area had expressed interest 
					in organizing a local chapter of NECA. There was no firm commitment for 
					membership, or money to seed a chapter.</p>
					<p>With a commitment from the National Electrical Contractors Association 
					to bring the convention to Philadelphia in 1939 to interest the local 
					contractors in organizing a chapter, Harry B. Frazer of the H.B. Frazer 
					Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania engaged a gentleman by the name of 
					Ernie Headler to arrange and promote an electrical industry trade show at 
					the Bellevue Strafford Hotel in Center City Philadelphia. The proceeds 
					of this show would be the seed money to organize the Penn-Del-Jersey 
					Chapter, NECA. With the support of industry suppliers and distributors, 
					and input from industry-related groups and utilities, Mr. Headler 
					successfully promoted this trade show at the Bellevue Strafford Hotel in 
					1939. With approximately $25,000 in proceeds the Penn-Del-Jersey Chapter, 
					NECA was organized, and the 36th National Convention was hosted in 
					Philadelphia at the Bellevue Strafford Hotel on October 9th through 12th. 
					At this convention Mr. Frazer's son, W. Edward, was elected to the NECA 
					National Executive Committee where he served through 1943, and was then 
					elected the NECA District Two Vice President where he served from 1944 
					to 1952. Mr. Frazer was instrumental in the creation of the National 
					Electrical Benefit Fund, (NEBF).</p>
					<p>For his efforts in the trade show promotion and organization of the 
					Chapter, Ernie Headler was offered the position of our first Chapter 
					Manager, which he enthusiastically accepted and went on to expand the 
					scope of the Chapter by organizing the Allentown, Easton, Delaware and 
					Lancaster Divisions. The Chapter was chartered on June 16, 1939.</p>
					<p>Since that time, and through the dedicated efforts of many member 
					contractors throughout Southeastern Pennsylvania and the State of Delaware, 
					the Chapter has added eleven additional divisions in the Chester, 
					Harrisburg, Line, Norristown, Reading, Scranton, Shamokin, Sound and 
					Communications, Wilkes-Barre, Williamsport and York areas. Our membership 
					has grown from a handful to a total of 150 members today.</p>
					<p>In recent years, the Chapter has grown with the initiation of our 
					Associate Membership Category. Associate Membership is restricted to 
					firms who do business with the electrical construction industry throughout 
					the Chapter's jurisdiction. </p>
