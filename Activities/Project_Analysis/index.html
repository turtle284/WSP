		<h1>Client: NECA PDJ Chapter</h1>
		<p class="subtitle">Website: www.neca-pdj.org</p>

			<h2>Site Intent</h2>
			<p>The primary intent of the site is to educate visitors.  Its main goal is to 
			have contractors sign up to be members.  Its secondary goal is to act as a 
			marketing tool for customers seeking an electrical contractor.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<h2>User Goals</h2>
			<p>The goals of the user depend on the type of user.  Contractors would use 
			the site to find more about membership or navigate the site to locate rates or 
			bylaws.  Customers would use the site to find a local contractor.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Re-design</h2>
			<p>The goal of the redesign is to present the content in a more appealing and 
			efficient manner.  The navigation is excessive, redundant, and inconsistent on 
			some of the pages.  I plan on consolidating some of the content in order to 
			simplify the navigation.</p>

			<p>The first two sites are neighboring chapters, which provide identical 
			services in different regions.  The third is a similar association in the 
			same area.  Marylandneca.org doesn’t really offer any relevant information, 
			but simply links to the national site neca.net.  Necany.org does offer local 
			news, which would affect the local industry.  Also the information links are 
			specific to that region.  Eap.org has inconsistent navigation across the pages 
			and is not intuitive.  While it does separate the information for the contractors 
			and for customers on it’s home page, that  separation ends there.</p>

			<h2>Case Personas</h2>
			<p>There are two types of visitors that would view the site.  One would be a 
			contractor looking to become a member, or access their membership information.  
			The second would be a general contractor looking for an electrical contractor 
			in the area with certain licenses.</p>
			<p>Bob is a contract manager looking for a sub-contractor.  He requires an 
			electrical contractor with the permits and licenses to work in Philadelphia on 
			industrial and residential jobs.  He also needs to know if they pay prevailing 
			wage to avoid issues with local unions.</p>
			<p>Chris owns a small electrical engineering firm.  He is looking to network 
			with contractors and suppliers in hopes to grow his business and increase his 
			profitability.  He would access the site to see the current list of members, 
			and ind information on the networking events.</p>
